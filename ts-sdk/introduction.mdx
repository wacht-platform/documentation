---

## Overview

The Wacht TypeScript SDK provides a comprehensive, type-safe client for all Wacht platform APIs. It is designed for both frontend and backend applications, offering excellent developer experience and flexibility. Additionally, it provides framework-specific authentication and authorization middlewares for popular environments like Node.js (Express-style) and Hono.

## Key Features

### Complete API Coverage
- **All Backend Endpoints** - Full coverage of Wacht platform APIs
- **Type-Safe Models** - Strongly typed request/response structures
- **Asynchronous Operations** - Modern asynchronous patterns with Promises
- **Axios-based HTTP Client** - Robust and flexible HTTP client

### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Validation** - Core JWT token validation logic within the main SDK
- **Framework-Specific Middlewares** - Dedicated middleware packages for Node.js (Express-style) and Hono for seamless integration.
- **Permission System** - Fine-grained permission checks at route and handler level (via middlewares)

### Developer Experience
- **Easy Initialization** - Simple SDK initialization
- **Environment Configuration** - Easy setup via environment variables
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Detailed error types with context

## Architecture

The SDK follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
wacht-ts
├── API Modules (Users, Organizations, Workspaces, etc.)
├── Core Authentication Logic (JWT validation, types)
├── Global Client Configuration
└── Error Handling

wacht-middleware-node
├── Node.js (Express-style) Authentication Middleware
└── Node.js (Express-style) Authorization Middleware

wacht-middleware-hono
├── Hono Authentication Middleware
└── Hono Authorization Middleware
```

## Use Cases

### Frontend Applications
Build secure frontend applications that interact with the Wacht platform:
- User authentication and session management
- Accessing user-specific data
- Integrating with Wacht APIs for various features

### Backend Services
Build secure backend services that interact with the Wacht platform:
- User management systems
- Organization and workspace administration
- AI agent orchestration
- Analytics and reporting services

### API Gateways
Create API gateways with built-in authentication:
- Validate JWT tokens from Wacht
- Enforce permissions at the gateway level
- Route requests based on user context
- Multi-tenant request routing

### Microservices
Build microservices that integrate with Wacht:
- Service-to-service authentication
- Permission-based access control
- Async task processing
- Event-driven architectures

## Getting Started

The SDK is designed to get you up and running quickly:

1. Install the `wacht-ts` package and the relevant middleware package (e.g., `wacht-middleware-node` or `wacht-middleware-hono`).
2. Set environment variables for API key and host.
3. Initialize the SDK in your application.
4. Start making API calls or integrate the authentication/authorization middlewares.

Continue to the [Installation](installation) guide to begin using the Wacht TypeScript SDK.
