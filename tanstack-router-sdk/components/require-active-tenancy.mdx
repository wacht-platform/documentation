# RequireActiveTenancy

Ensures that a valid organization and workspace (if enabled) are selected before rendering its children. If no valid tenancy exists, shows an organization/workspace selector dialog.

```tsx
import { RequireActiveTenancy } from "@wacht/tanstack-router";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <RequireActiveTenancy>
      <YourProtectedApp />
    </RequireActiveTenancy>
  );
}
```

## Validation

Returns `null` while loading. Checks for:

- Active organization selected (if organizations enabled)
- Active workspace selected (if workspaces enabled)
- No eligibility restrictions on current memberships

When validation fails, shows a dialog with organization selector, workspace selector (if applicable), and create options.

## Params

<ParamField path="children" type="ReactNode">
Content to render when tenancy is valid.
</ParamField>
