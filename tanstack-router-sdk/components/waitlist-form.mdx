# WaitlistForm

Allows users to join a waitlist when your deployment has `sign_up_mode` set to `"waitlist"`. Users without an invitation token are redirected to this form.

```tsx
import { WaitlistForm } from "@wacht/tanstack-router";

export default function WaitlistPage() {
  return <WaitlistForm />;
}
```

## Form Fields

```typescript
interface WaitlistParams {
  first_name?: string;
  last_name?: string;
  email: string;
}
```

First and last name are optional based on deployment settings. Email is always required.

After successful submission, shows a success message with confirmation that notification will be sent to the provided email.
