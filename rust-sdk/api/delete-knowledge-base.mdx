```

## Error Handling

```rust
match delete_knowledge_base("52057194421551105").await {

        println!("Knowledge base deleted successfully");
    }
    Err(Error::Api { status, message, .. }) => {
        match status.as_u16() {
            404 => println!("Knowledge base not found"),
            403 => println!("Access denied: {}", message),
            409 => println!("Cannot delete knowledge base in use: {}", message),
            _ => println!("API error {}: {}", status, message),

    }
    Err(e) => println!("Request failed: {}", e),
}
```
