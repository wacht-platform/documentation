## Overview

The Deployments API allows you to manage deployment-related operations, such as generating JWT tokens.

### `generateToken(deploymentId: number, request: GenerateTokenRequest)`

Generates a JWT token for a given session with optional custom claims using Handlebars templates. The token includes standard claims (iss, sub, iat, exp, session_id) plus organization and workspace permissions if applicable. Custom claims can be added using JWT templates with Handlebars syntax that has access to user, session, organization, and workspace data.

#### Parameters

- `deploymentId` (number): The ID of the deployment.
- `request` (GenerateTokenRequest): The request body containing details for token generation.

#### Returns

`Promise<GenerateTokenResponse>`: A promise that resolves to the generated JWT token response.
