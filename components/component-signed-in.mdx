## Overview

The `<SignedIn />` component conditionally renders its children only when a user is authenticated. It's perfect for showing content that should only be visible to signed-in users.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { SignedIn } from '@snipextt/wacht'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>
        <div>Welcome back! You are signed in.</div>
        <UserDashboard />
      </SignedIn>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Props

<ParamField path="children" type="React.ReactNode" required>
  The content to render when the user is signed in.
</ParamField>

## What it includes

- **Conditional Rendering** - Only shows children when user is authenticated
- **Loading Handling** - Hides content while authentication is loading
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal re-renders, only updates when auth state changes
- **SSR Friendly** - Works with server-side rendering
