## Overview

The `<SignedOut />` component conditionally renders its children only when a user is not authenticated. It's perfect for showing sign-in prompts, marketing content, or public information to unauthenticated visitors.

## Basic Usage

```tsx
import { SignedOut } from '@snipextt/wacht'

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedOut>
        <div>Please sign in to access your account</div>
        <SignInForm />
      </SignedOut>
    </>
  )
}
```

## Props

<ParamField path="children" type="React.ReactNode" required>
  The content to render when the user is not signed in.
</ParamField>

## What it includes

- **Conditional Rendering** - Only shows children when user is not authenticated
- **Loading Handling** - Hides content while authentication is loading
- **Performance Optimized** - Minimal re-renders, only updates when auth state changes
- **SEO Friendly** - Unauthenticated content can be statically rendered
