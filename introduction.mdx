## Architecture

Wacht follows a multi-tenant architecture that supports complex organizational structures:

```
Deployment (Your App)
├── Organization A
│   ├── Workspace 1
│   ├── Workspace 2
│   └── Users with roles
└── Organization B
    ├── Workspace 1
    └── Users with roles
```

This structure allows you to build applications that support:
- Single-tenant applications (one organization)
- Multi-tenant SaaS applications (multiple organizations)
- Enterprise applications with complex hierarchies
