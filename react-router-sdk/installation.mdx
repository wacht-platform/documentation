## Requirements

Before installing the React Router SDK, ensure you have:

- **React 18+** - The SDK requires React 18 or later
- **React Router v7** - Built specifically for React Router v7
- **pnpm 8+** (recommended) - Or npm 9+
- **Wacht Deployment** - A Wacht deployment with a public key

## Installation

Install the React Router SDK and its dependencies:

```bash
pnpm add @wacht/react-router @wacht/types
```

Or with npm:

```bash
npm install @wacht/react-router @wacht/types
```

## Environment Variables

Add your Wacht public key to your environment variables:

```bash
# .env
WACHT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_public_key_here
```

You can find your public key in your Wacht deployment settings.

## TypeScript Configuration

The SDK includes TypeScript definitions out of the box. No additional configuration is needed if you're using TypeScript.

## Peer Dependencies

The SDK has the following peer dependencies that must be installed in your project:

```json
{
  "peerDependencies": {
    "@wacht/types": "*",
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0",
    "react-router": "^7.0.0"
  }
}
```

## Verification

To verify the installation:

```tsx
import { DeploymentProvider } from '@wacht/react-router'

// This should work without errors
console.log(DeploymentProvider)
```
