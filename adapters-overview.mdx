## What are Adapters?

Platform adapters provide routing integration for different React frameworks. They handle navigation, URL updates, and framework-specific routing patterns, ensuring that Wacht's authentication flows work seamlessly with your chosen routing solution.

## Why Use Adapters?

Adapters bridge the gap between Wacht's authentication system and your application's routing:

- **Automatic Navigation** - Handle redirects after sign-in, sign-up, and sign-out
- **URL Management** - Update browser URLs when switching organizations or workspaces
- **Framework Integration** - Work with framework-specific routing patterns
- **Protected Routes** - Enable route-level authentication protection

## Available Adapters

### Next.js Adapter
- **Package**: `@snipextt/wacht-nextjs`
- **Supports**: App Router and Pages Router
- **Features**: SSR compatibility, middleware integration, automatic navigation

### React Router Adapter  
- **Package**: `@snipextt/wacht-react-router`
- **Supports**: React Router v6
- **Features**: Programmatic navigation, protected routes, history management

### Custom Adapter
- **For**: Custom routing solutions or other frameworks
- **Implementation**: Create your own adapter using the platform adapter interface

## How Adapters Work

Adapters implement a standard interface that Wacht uses for navigation:

```tsx
interface PlatformAdapter {
  navigate: (url: string) => void
  getCurrentPath: () => string
  // Additional framework-specific methods
}
```

When you sign in, sign out, or switch organizations, Wacht calls the adapter's navigation methods to update your application's routing state.

## Choosing an Adapter

- **Using Next.js?** → Use the Next.js adapter
- **Using React Router?** → Use the React Router adapter  
- **Custom routing?** → Create a custom adapter
- **No routing needs?** → You can use Wacht without an adapter (manual navigation)
