# SignUpForm

Complete user registration interface with field validation, email/phone verification, social authentication, invitation support, and redirect handling.

```tsx
import { SignUpForm } from "@wacht/tanstack-router";

export default function SignUpPage() {
  return <SignUpForm />;
}
```

## Form Fields

```typescript
interface SignUpParams {
  first_name?: string;
  last_name?: string;
  username?: string;
  email?: string;
  phone_number?: string;
  password?: string;
  phone_country_code?: string;
  invite_token?: string;
}
```

## Invitation Tokens

Pass an invitation token via URL to pre-fill fields and handle organization/workspace invitations:

```tsx
// User will be pre-filled and added to the organization after sign-up
/signup?invite_token=abc123
```

If your deployment has `sign_up_mode` set to `"waitlist"`, users without an invitation token will be redirected to the waitlist page. If set to `"restricted"`, new registrations are blocked.

## Redirect Handling

After successful sign-up, the user is redirected based on:

1. The `redirect_uri` query parameter (if present)
2. The `after_signup_redirect_url` deployment setting
3. The deployment's frontend host (fallback)

For example, `/signup?redirect_uri=/onboarding` will bring users to `/onboarding` after sign-up completes.
