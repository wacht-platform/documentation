```

## Error Handling

```rust
match delete_workspace("52057194421551105").await {
    Ok(()) => {
        println!("Workspace deleted successfully");
    }
    Err(Error::Api { status, message, .. }) => {
        match status.as_u16() {
            404 => println!("Workspace not found"),
            403 => println!("Access denied: {}", message),
            409 => println!("Cannot delete workspace with active members: {}", message),
            _ => println!("API error {}: {}", status, message),
