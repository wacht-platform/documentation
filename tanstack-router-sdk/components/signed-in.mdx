import { SignedIn } from "@wacht/tanstack-router";

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <SignedIn>
      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>This content is only visible to signed-in users.</p>
    </SignedIn>
  );
}
```

## Protected Route

import { SignedIn, NavigateToSignIn } from "@wacht/tanstack-router";

export default function ProtectedPage() {
  return (
    <>
      <SignedIn>
        <ProtectedContent />
      </SignedIn>
      <NavigateToSignIn />
    </>
  );
}
```
