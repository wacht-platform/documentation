description: 'Complete Rust SDK for Wacht platform with authentication middleware'
---

## Overview

The Wacht Rust SDK provides a comprehensive, type-safe client for all Wacht platform APIs along with production-ready authentication middleware for Axum web applications. Built with modern Rust patterns, it offers excellent performance and developer experience.

## Key Features

### Complete API Coverage
- **All 72 Backend Endpoints** - Full coverage of Wacht platform APIs
- **Type-Safe Models** - Strongly typed request/response structures
- **Async/Await** - Modern asynchronous Rust with Tokio
- **Automatic Retries** - Built-in retry logic for transient failures

### Authentication Middleware
- **JWT Validation** - Production-ready JWT token validation
- **Multiple Algorithms** - Support for HS256/384/512, RS256/384/512, ES256/384
- **Permission System** - Fine-grained permission checks at route and handler level
- **Axum Integration** - Seamless integration with Axum web framework

### Developer Experience
- **Lazy Initialization** - Global HTTP client with connection pooling
- **Environment Configuration** - Easy setup via environment variables
- **Comprehensive Error Handling** - Detailed error types with context
- **Tracing Support** - Built-in observability with tracing crate

## Architecture

The SDK follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
wacht-rs
├── API Modules (Users, Organizations, Workspaces, etc.)
├── Authentication Middleware
│   ├── JWT Validation Layer
│   ├── Permission Layers
│   └── Request Extractors
├── Global Client Configuration
└── Error Handling
```

## Use Cases

### Backend Services
Build secure backend services that interact with the Wacht platform:
- User management systems
- Organization and workspace administration
- AI agent orchestration
- Analytics and reporting services

### API Gateways
Create API gateways with built-in authentication:
- Validate JWT tokens from Wacht
- Enforce permissions at the gateway level
- Route requests based on user context
- Multi-tenant request routing

### Microservices
Build microservices that integrate with Wacht:
- Service-to-service authentication
- Permission-based access control
- Async task processing
- Event-driven architectures

## Comparison with React SDK

While the React SDK focuses on frontend authentication flows and UI components, the Rust SDK provides:

| Feature | React SDK | Rust SDK |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Target | Frontend applications | Backend services |
| Authentication | Client-side flows | JWT validation middleware |
| API Access | Limited frontend APIs | All backend APIs |
| Components | UI components | Middleware layers |
| State Management | React hooks | Stateless validation |
| Use Case | User-facing apps | Services & APIs |

## Getting Started

The SDK is designed to get you up and running quickly:

1. Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`
2. Set environment variables for API key and host
3. Initialize the SDK in your main function
4. Start making API calls or add auth middleware
