# SignInForm

Complete sign-in interface supporting email/password, email OTP, phone OTP, magic links, passkeys, social OAuth, SSO, two-factor authentication, forgot password, and profile completion.

```tsx
import { SignInForm } from "@wacht/react-router";

export default function SignInPage() {
  return <SignInForm />;
}
```

The form adapts based on your deployment's authentication settings:

1. **Identification Phase** - User enters email/username/phone
2. **Strategy Detection** - System detects available authentication methods
3. **Authentication Phase** - User completes authentication (password, OTP, etc.)
4. **Verification Phase** - Email/phone verification if required
5. **Second Factor** - 2FA if enabled
6. **Profile Completion** - Additional profile info if required
7. **Redirect** - User is redirected to the appropriate page

## Redirect Handling

After successful sign-in, the user is redirected based on:

1. The `redirect_uri` query parameter (if present)
2. The `after_signin_redirect_url` deployment setting
3. The deployment's frontend host (fallback)

For example, `/signin?redirect_uri=/dashboard` will bring users to `/dashboard` after sign-in completes.
