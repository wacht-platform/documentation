description: 'Complete Rust SDK for Wacht platform with authentication middleware'
---

## Overview

The Wacht Rust SDK provides a type-safe client for all Wacht platform APIs and authentication middleware for Axum web applications.

## Features

### API Client
- **All 72 Backend Endpoints** - Full coverage of Wacht platform APIs
- **Type-Safe Models** - Typed request/response structures
- **Async/Await** - Async support with Tokio
- **Automatic Retries** - Built-in retry logic

### Authentication Middleware
- **JWT Validation** - JWT token validation
- **Multiple Algorithms** - Support for HS256/384/512, RS256/384/512, ES256/384
- **Permission System** - Permission checks at route and handler level
- **Axum Integration** - Integration with Axum web framework

### Developer Tools
- **Global Client** - HTTP client with connection pooling
- **Environment Configuration** - Setup via environment variables
- **Error Handling** - Detailed error types
- **Tracing Support** - Observability with tracing crate

## Architecture

```

```

## Use Cases

### Backend Services
- User management systems
- Organization and workspace administration
- AI agent orchestration
- Analytics and reporting services

### API Gateways
- Validate JWT tokens from Wacht
- Enforce permissions at the gateway level
- Route requests based on user context
- Multi-tenant request routing

### Microservices
- Service-to-service authentication
- Permission-based access control
- Async task processing

## Comparison with React SDK

While the React SDK focuses on frontend authentication flows and UI components, the Rust SDK provides:

| Feature | React SDK | Rust SDK |
|---------|-----------|----------|
| Target | Frontend applications | Backend services |
| Authentication | Client-side flows | JWT validation middleware |
| API Access | Limited frontend APIs | All backend APIs |
| Components | UI components | Middleware layers |
| State Management | React hooks | Stateless validation |
| Use Case | User-facing apps | Services & APIs |

## Getting Started

The SDK is designed to get you up and running quickly:

1. Add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`
2. Set environment variables for API key and host
3. Initialize the SDK in your main function
4. Start making API calls or add auth middleware
