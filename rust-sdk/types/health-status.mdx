description: "Health check response with service status information"
---

## Overview

The `HealthStatus` struct represents the comprehensive health status of the API and its dependent services.

## Definition

```rust
pub struct HealthStatus {
    pub status: String,
    pub version: String,
    pub timestamp: String,
    pub services: Vec<ServiceHealth>,
}
```

## Fields

<ParamField path="status" type="String" required>
  The overall health status of the API. Typically "healthy", "degraded", or "unhealthy".
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="version" type="String" required>
  The current version of the API.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="timestamp" type="String" required>
  ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the health check was performed.
</ParamField>

<ParamField path="services" type="Vec<ServiceHealth>" required>
  A vector containing the health status of individual services and dependencies.
</ParamField>

## Usage Example

```rust
use wacht_rs::api::health::check_health;

let health = check_health().await?;

println!("API Health: {}", health.status);
println!("Version: {}", health.version);
println!("Checked at: {}", health.timestamp);

// Check individual services
println!("\nService Status:");
for service in &health.services {
    println!("  {}: {}", service.name, service.status);
    if let Some(message) = &service.message {
        println!("    Message: {}", message);
    }
}

// Determine if all services are healthy
let all_healthy = health.services.iter()
    .all(|s| s.status == "healthy");

if !all_healthy {
    println!("\nWarning: Some services are not healthy!");
    
    // Find unhealthy services
    let unhealthy_services: Vec<&ServiceHealth> = health.services.iter()
        .filter(|s| s.status != "healthy")
        .collect();
    
    for service in unhealthy_services {
        println!("  - {} is {}", service.name, service.status);
    }
}

// Simple health check
match health.status.as_str() {
    "healthy" => println!("✅ All systems operational"),
    "degraded" => println!("⚠️  Some services degraded"),
    "unhealthy" => println!("❌ System unhealthy"),
    _ => println!("Unknown status: {}", health.status),
}
```
